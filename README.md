# Actualizer, version 1.1: (August 30, 2013)
This is WEB application based on Apps from Gurtam (http://apps.wialon.com).

## Description
"Actualizer" is an application that allows you to detect "dead units", i.e., units that have not sent any data for a long period. Unit's activity is estimated according to the time of the last message received from it.

At launching, all available units are displayed in the order beginning form the most 'inactive' one. For your convenience, information about the last message is represented simultaneously in two forms: (1) date and time of the message and (2) how many days ago.

The list of units can be sorted by last message time as well as by name. Furthermore, filtration by days can be applied, i.e., you can get a list of units not sending data for N and more days.
